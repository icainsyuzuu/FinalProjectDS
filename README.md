### Theme Explanation
**Main Focus:**
The system is designed to analyze and predict the classification of stunting in children based on several features such as Gender, Age, Birth Weight, Birth Length, Body Weight, and Body Length.
- **Key Components:**
Data Gathering: Collecting and examining initial data.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, transforming data types, and preparing data for analysis.
Modeling: Building a classification model using a Decision Tree.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy.
Visualization: Using a confusion matrix plot for model interpretation.
Shiny App: Creating an interactive interface for stunting prediction.
- **Objectives:**
Provide a simple predictive tool to assist in classifying stunting in children.
Help health professionals or researchers understand the data and make evidence-based decisions.
- **Visual Theme of the Shiny App:**
Using theme colors such as "bg-primary-subtle" for stunting cases and "bg-success-subtle" for non-stunting cases, the app offers clear and easily understandable visualization.
